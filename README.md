# Jump LED
An outreach project for the [Neurobionics lab](https://neurobionics.engin.umich.edu/) in collaboration with [Gray Thomas](https://graythomas.github.io/).
This code is for a simple educational kit for high school students which combines concepts from biomechanics and robotics.
We used a raspberry Pi and an accelerometer to make a wearable device that senses when the wearer jumps and lights up a
number of LEDs in response to how high the wearer jumped.
